    <h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Like most website operators, Acadepra collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
        browsers
        and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the
        date
        and time of each visitor request. Acadepra's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
        better understand how Acadepra's visitors use its website. From time to time, Acadepra may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
        its
        website.</p>
    <p>Acadepra also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
        logged-in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.acadepra.com blog posts. Acadepra only discloses
        logged-in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Certain visitors to Acadepra's websites choose to interact with Acadepra in ways that require Acadepra to gather
        personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that Acadepra gathers depend on the
        nature of
        the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at http://www.acadepra.com to provide a
        username
        and email address.</p>

    <p><br></p>
    <h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over
        the
        Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means
        to
        protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2 id="Ads">4. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
        cookies
        allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
        information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other
        things,
        deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers
        the
        use of cookies by Acadepra and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2 id="ExternalLinks">5. Links To External Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link,
        you
        will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and Terms of
        service of every site you visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
        third-party sites, products, or services.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2 id="PIIProtection">6. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Acadepra discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
        employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
        it
        on Acadepra's behalf or to provide services available at Acadepra's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to
        disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside
        of
        your home country; by using Acadepra's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
        Acadepra
        will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other
        than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Acadepra discloses
        potentially
        personally identifying and personally identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or
        another
        governmental request, or when Acadepra believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect
        the
        property or rights of Acadepra, third parties or the public at large.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered user of http://www.acadepra.com and have supplied your email address, Acadepra may
        occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
        date
        with what's going on with Acadepra and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
        information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
        support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
        clarify
        or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Acadepra takes all measures reasonably necessary
        to
        protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
        and
        personally-identifying information.</p>
